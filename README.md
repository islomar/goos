# GOOS notes
Notes and code related with the book "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests".

## My notes
* Write an Adapter Layer.
* Mock Application Objects in Integration Tests: mock the callback interfaces.
* An important part of the test-driven development skills is judging where to set the boundaries of what to test and how to eventually cover everything.
* XMPP broker: OpenFire + Smack library
    * https://hub.docker.com/r/gizmotronic/openfire/
* Swing test framework: WindowLicker
* An ApplicationRunner is an object that wraps up all management and communicating with the Swing application weâ€™re building.

## What would I do differently?
* The naming for the assertion tests in the end2end test: always a prefix like "verifyXxx" o "checkXxx".
